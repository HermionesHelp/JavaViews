    <li>bullet point 1</li>
    <li>bullet point 2</li>
</ul>
<p>Just plain old HTML. Nothing special going on here.</p>
<p>We still have to mark this file as <b>xmlns:th="http://www.thymeleaf.org"</b> because the Thymeleaf engine is still building this HTML file for us.
    The only thing that is being added to this file is our fragment, but even if it didn't have that it still needs to be built. And that's one of
    Thymeleaf's responsibilities.</p>
